# 🌐 Network Simulator Tool 🛠️

Welcome to my Network Simulator Tool, a simple Python application built to simulate network operations. The tool is designed to help network researchers and engineers understand the workings of networks by providing a simple yet effective simulation environment.

## 🔧 Features

Network Simulator Tool has the following features:

- Define nodes and links
- Set speed and latency parameters for each link
- Send data across the network
- Simulate data transmission times and latencies


## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the Network Simulator Tool, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. 

### 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nunoguilherme/net-sim.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd net-sim
    ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## 📚 Usage

After running the `main.py` script, you'll see a Tkinter window with a button labeled "Create Network". Click this button to simulate the creation of a network with 3 nodes (A, B, and C) and links between them. The console will print messages showing the process of data being sent and received across the network.

## 🤝 Contributing
