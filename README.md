# Network Simulator

This is a basic network simulator built with Python. It simulates nodes (computers) and links (connections between computers).

## Running the Simulator

To run the simulator, first activate the virtual environment:

source venv/bin/activate


Then, run the simulator:

python main.py


## Future Improvements

This is a very basic network simulator. Future improvementscould include simulating network protocols, traffic patterns, congestion, packet loss, and more.
